Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly grown in capability and influence.  Systems based on machine learning are now commonplace in fields ranging from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment.  Deep learning, in particular, has enabled breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing and game playing.  One factor driving this progress is the availability of large datasets and increased computational power.  Another factor is the use of novel architectures such as transformers, which allow models to attend to different parts of their input and capture long‑range dependencies.

Despite these advances, AI faces several challenges.  Lack of transparency in decision making has led to calls for explainable AI.  Bias in training data can result in unfair outcomes when models are deployed in the real world.  Additionally, many models require significant energy to train and run, raising environmental concerns.  Researchers are exploring techniques to reduce these negative effects, including efficient training algorithms, fairness‑aware learning methods and accountability frameworks.

AI also offers opportunities to address global problems.  In healthcare, machine learning models can help detect diseases earlier and personalise treatments.  In environmental science, AI techniques can analyse satellite imagery to monitor deforestation and predict extreme weather events.  Combining AI with domain expertise could therefore enable more effective interventions in areas such as climate change and public health.
