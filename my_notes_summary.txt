The Logic of a Simple Python Program The foundation of any successful program is a clear purpose, which involves taking user input and processing it to generate a specific output. To make the program efficient, loops are used to repeat tasks automatically, preventing the need to write the same instructions multiple times. Beyond basic logic, professional code is organized into functions, which are blocks of reusable code that perform a single action. To help others understand the code, I included comments, which are notes that explain the logic but are ignored by the Python interpreter. Safety is also a priority; therefore, I implemented error handling (using try-except blocks) to prevent the program from crashing if a user enters invalid data.
